The following sections describe where to accomplish those tasks\.

In this tutorial, you will receive email for a domain that you have registered with Route 53\. To get this domain, you can either [register a new domain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html) or [transfer an existing domain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-to-route-53.html)\. Transferring an existing domain can take several days\.
