## Register a Domain using Route 53<a name="receiving-email-getting-started-domain"></a>

This tutorial assumes that you're using a domain that you registered using Route 53\. You can also use a domain that you registered using another service, but the procedures for verifying your domain will differ from those shown in this tutorial\. For more information about using Route 53 to register a domain, see [Register a New Domain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.

You can also transfer an existing domain to Route 53\. For more information about transferring domains to Route 53, see [Transferring Registration for a Domain to Route 53](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-transfer-to-route-53.html) in the *Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide*\.
