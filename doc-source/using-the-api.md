You can access the Amazon SES API using an [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/), which wraps the low\-level functionality of the Amazon SES API with higher\-level data types and function calls that take care of the details for you\. You can also make raw requests to the Amazon SES Query API over HTTPS\. For general information about the Query API, see [Amazon SES Query API](query-interface.md)\. Individual API operations are described in the * [Amazon Simple Email Service API Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/)*\.
