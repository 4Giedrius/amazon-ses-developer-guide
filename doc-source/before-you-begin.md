Before you start, you need to set up Amazon SES\. Whether you send an email by using the Amazon SES console, the SMTP interface, or the Amazon SES API, you need to: 

+ **Sign up for AWS—**Before you can use Amazon SES or other AWS services, you need to create an AWS account\. For information, see [Signing up for AWS](sign-up-for-aws.md)\.

+ **Verify your email address or domain—** To send emails using Amazon SES, you always need to verify your "From" address to show that you own it\. If you are in the sandbox, you also need to verify your "To" addresses\. You can verify email addresses or entire domains\. For information, see [Verifying Identities in Amazon SES](verify-addresses-and-domains.md)\.

This list contains the setup tasks that are mandatory for all email sending methods\. Additional setup tasks that are specific to the email sending method are provided in the corresponding getting started section\.
