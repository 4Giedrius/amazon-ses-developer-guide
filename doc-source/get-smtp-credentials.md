# Getting Your SMTP Credentials for Amazon SES<a name="get-smtp-credentials"></a>

To use the Amazon SES SMTP interface, you must first create an SMTP user name and password\. To get your SMTP Credentials, see [Obtaining Your Amazon SES SMTP Credentials](smtp-credentials.md)\.

**Important**  
Your SMTP user name and password are not the same as your AWS access key ID and secret access key\. Do not attempt to use your AWS credentials to authenticate yourself to the Amazon SES SMTP endpoint\. For more information about credentials, see [Using Credentials With Amazon SES](using-credentials.md)\.
