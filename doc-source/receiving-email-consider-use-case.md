# Considering Your Use Case for Amazon SES Email Receiving<a name="receiving-email-consider-use-case"></a>

Before you set up Amazon SES to receive your mail, you might find it helpful to consider the following questions\.

## Email Content<a name="receiving-email-consider-use-case-content"></a>

+ **How do you want Amazon SES to pass you the email content?**

  Amazon SES can provide you the email content in two ways: it can store the emails in an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify, or it can send you an Amazon SNS notification that contains a copy of the email\. Amazon SES delivers you the raw, unmodified email, which is typically in Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions \(MIME\) format\. For more information about MIME format, see [RFC 2045](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045)\. 

+ **How large of a limit on email size do you need?**

  If you choose to store emails in an Amazon S3 bucket, the maximum email size \(including headers\) is 30 MB\. If you choose to receive your emails through Amazon SNS notifications, the maximum email size \(including headers\) is 150 KB\.

+ **How do you want to trigger the processing of your mail?**

  After your mail is delivered, you will want to process it with your own code\. For example, your application might convert the base 64\-encoded email into a displayable format and then make it available to an end user through an email client\. There are a couple of ways you can start the process:

  + If your emails are delivered to Amazon S3, your application can listen for Amazon SNS notifications generated by S3 actions, extract the message ID of the email from the notifications, and then use the message ID to retrieve the email from Amazon S3\.

    Alternatively, you can incorporate email processing into your receipt rules by writing a Lambda function\. In this case, your receipt rule should first write the email to Amazon S3, and then trigger the Lambda function\. Lambda actions can be executed synchronously or asynchronously from within your receipt rules, depending on whether the Lambda function needs to return a result that influences how other actions are executed\. We recommend that you use asynchronous execution unless synchronous is absolutely necessary for your use case\. For more information about AWS Lambda, see the [AWS Lambda Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html)\.

  + If your emails are delivered through an Amazon SNS notification by using the SNS action, your application can listen for Amazon SNS notifications, and then extract the email messages from the notifications\.

+ **Do you want the emails to be encrypted?**

  Amazon SES integrates with AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) to optionally encrypt the mail it writes to your Amazon S3 bucket\. Amazon SES uses client\-side encryption to encrypt your mail before writing it to Amazon S3\. This means that you must decrypt the content on your side after retrieving the mail from Amazon S3\. The [AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/) and [AWS SDK for Ruby](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/) provide a client that can handle the decryption for you\. Amazon SES can encrypt the emails for you only if you choose for your emails to be delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket\.

## Unwanted Mail<a name="receiving-email-consider-use-case-unwanted"></a>

+ **At what point in the email\-receiving process do you want to reject unwanted mail?**

  You can reject emails at two points in the email\-receiving process: during the SMTP conversation with the sender's mail server, and after delivery when you can examine the email's properties\. You are not billed for any mail that is rejected during the SMTP conversation, so it is to your advantage to reject as much unwanted mail as possible at that time\. You can reject emails during the SMTP conversation with IP address filters and receipt rules, both of which are described in [Email\-Receiving Concepts](receiving-email-concepts.md)\.

  After the SMTP conversation, Amazon SES performs virus scanning, spam scanning, as well as authentication checks for DomainKeys Identified Mail \(DKIM\), Sender Policy Framework \(SPF\), and Domain\-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance \(DMARC\)\. Amazon SES makes the verdicts of all these tests available to you so you can decide if you trust the email\. If you don't trust the email, you can drop it or send a bounce response to the sender\. You will be billed for the email because this decision point occurs after Amazon SES delivered the email to you\. If you use Lambda to send a bounce response, you may also be billed for your usage of Lambda\.

+ **Do you want to filter your emails based on any property other than recipient or IP address?**

  You can write complex message\-matching conditions using Lambda functions \(invoked as "RequestResponse"\) and then incorporate those functions into your receipt rules\. The return value of the Lambda function determines whether the evaluation of the receipt rule and receipt rule set should continue or stop\. For example, you can have a receipt rule that drops mail that Amazon SES flags as spam\. You can also bounce messages that do not pass certain authentication tests, such as DKIM or DMARC\. Code examples for both of these situations are available in [Lambda Function Examples](receiving-email-action-lambda-example-functions.md)\.

## Using Other AWS Services<a name="receiving-email-consider-use-case-permissions"></a>

+ **Have you set up the appropriate permissions?**

  If you want your mail to be delivered to an Amazon S3 bucket, published to an Amazon SNS topic you don't own, trigger a Lambda function, or use a custom master AWS KMS key, you need to give Amazon SES permission to access those resources\. To give Amazon SES access, you create policies on resources from the consoles or APIs for those AWS services\. For more information [Giving Permissions](receiving-email-permissions.md)\.

## Mail Streams<a name="receiving-email-consider-use-case-streams"></a>

+ **How do you want to divide your mail stream?**

  Your domain most likely receives different classes of mail\. For example, some of your domain's mail, such as an email to *user@example\.com*, might be intended for a personal inbox\. Other mail, such as an email to *unsubscribe@example\.com*, might be better directed to automated systems instead\. You can use receipt rules to divide your incoming mail so that it can be processed differently\. For information about how to set up receipt rules, see [Creating Receipt Rules](receiving-email-receipt-rules.md)\.
